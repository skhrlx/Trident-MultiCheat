⚠️ Use it only for learning, it's a old source, and probably detected, since I learned with it, don't care about the shitty code. 

It probably have some bugs, and the arduino code provided is just an example, it is outdated related the source... The Aimbot and triggerbot is super slowed. You can use a library, like DXcam to speed it up since he uses desktop duplication. And use a usb host shield, and if possible, an esp8266 to avoid COM communication, since it is probably detected by vanguard.
